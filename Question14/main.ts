// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guest_list:string[] = ["aisha","rashid","ali","mubben","gulay","shahid","hassan"];
guest_list.forEach((person) => {
 console.log(`I would like to invite ${person} at ramadan Iftar Party `);
});
